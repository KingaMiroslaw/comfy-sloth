# About The App

The Comfy Sloth it is a project of a furniture website, where we can get acquainted with the store's assortment and purchase selected products.

The project was created while attending the [React 18 Tutorial and Projects Course (2023)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/) created by John Smilga. The main goals of the project was to broaden knowledge, especially in the field of [Context and Reducer](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) and working with API using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro). In addition, the basic tools of [React](https://reactjs.org/) itself were practiced, creating styles using [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/), as well as user authorization using [auth0](https://auth0.com/) and and payment using [Google Pay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-pay/button-react).
